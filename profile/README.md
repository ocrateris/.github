## About
`Ocrateris`--aka Delta Crateris--is a solitary star in the southern constellation of Crater. Often associated with a crow or raven, legend has it that Crater was cast into the sky by Apollo. 

Here, `Ocrateris` serves as a set of documents and implementations that provide recommended structures and integrations of cloud native products and services to form a serverless, graphql solution. Ocrateris seeks to embody accepted industry best practices that suggest the optimal delivery method for the technologies specified herein.

### Features
- **Built on the Apollo Graph Platform**: The leading open-source GraphQL implementation with 17M downloads per month and the only end-to-end cloud management solution for GraphQL. Get unmatched insights into how your APIs are being consumed by tracking activity and changes field-by-field and client-by-client.  Know when it’s time to deprecate fields and how to resolve performance challenges.
- **One Unified Graph**: Maximizes the value of GraphQL. Code, queries, skills, and experience made portable across teams. Federated implementation across multiple backend services unlocking faster delivery for engineering teams.
- **Multiple AWS Account Strategy**: Isolate and manage business applications and data in discrete environments to enhance operational excellence, security, reliability, and cost optimization.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ocrateris leverages the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to define cloud application resources using familiar programming languages, providing high-level components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert.
- **Serverless, Cloud-Native Microservices**: Take full advantage of the cloud computing model, empowering the organization to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments. Get new ideas to market immediately.
